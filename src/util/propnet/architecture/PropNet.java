/**
 * The PropNet class is designed to represent Propositional Networks.
 * 
 * A propositional network (also known as a "propnet") is a way of representing
 * a game as a logic circuit. States of the game are represented by assignments
 * of TRUE or FALSE to "base" propositions, each of which represents a single
 * fact that can be true about the state of the game. For example, in a game of
 * Tic-Tac-Toe, the fact (cell 1 1 x) indicates that the cell (1,1) has an 'x'
 * in it. That fact would correspond to a base proposition, which would be set
 * to TRUE to indicate that the fact is true in the current state of the game.
 * Likewise, the base corresponding to the fact (cell 1 1 o) would be false,
 * because in that state of the game there isn't an 'o' in the cell (1,1).
 * 
 * A state of the game is uniquely determined by the assignment of truth values
 * to the base propositions in the propositional network. Every assignment of
 * truth values to base propositions corresponds to exactly one unique state of
 * the game.
 * 
 * Given the values of the base propositions, you can use the connections in
 * the network (AND gates, OR gates, NOT gates) to determine the truth values
 * of other propositions. For example, you can determine whether the terminal
 * proposition is true: if that proposition is true, the game is over when it
 * reaches this state. Otherwise, if it is false, the game isn't over. You can
 * also determine the value of the goal propositions, which represent facts
 * like (goal xplayer 100). If that proposition is true, then that fact is true
 * in this state of the game, which means that xplayer has 100 points.
 * 
 * You can also use a propositional network to determine the next state of the
 * game, given the current state and the moves for each player. First, you set
 * the input propositions which correspond to each move to TRUE. Once that has
 * been done, you can determine the truth value of the transitions. Each base
 * proposition has a "transition" component going into it. This transition has
 * the truth value that its base will take on in the next state of the game.
 * 
 * For further information about propositional networks, see:
 * 
 * "Decomposition of Games for Efficient Reasoning" by Eric Schkufza.
 * "Factoring General Games using Propositional Automata" by Evan Cox et al.
